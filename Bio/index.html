      A little about me...
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Victoria Lybarger, and I am a young artist from Winfield, Kansas. Currently, I am a senior at Southwestern College majoring in digital arts.

      My inspiration comes from the friends, family, and the experiences that are around me. In my free time, I enjoys good conversation while drinking great coffee at the local coffee shop. Besides digital art, I lead worship at First United Methodist Church and take couple, family, and nature photography. I love to support local establishments as often as I can because I hopes people choose me over big business one day.
